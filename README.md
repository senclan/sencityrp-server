# SEN City RP

## This is not being developed further

This was one of my first python projects. When talking with friends and
reminiscing of old times, I decided to put the code up on here.

The files in here were for the most part just pulled and added to git in their
current states. Use at your own risk.

## Introduction

SEN City RP is roleplay addon for a Battlefield 2 mod,
[Sandbox](http://sandboxmod.com).

This addon was developed by Mike__MRM. Original map created by Bullace. Map
buildings and assets built by DaBigTuna, Shorty1325 (Reflex), Dragoon, MaxNice
and Mike__MRM.

Special Thanks to CrazyIvan1745, UberWazuSoldier, BlowUpYou and Bullace.

## Installation

The mod required many of the core sandbox files to be changed in order to limit
users abilities, due to this the entire `python` directory needs to be replaced.

The easiest installation would be to simply clone this repo into an empty
`mods/sandbox` directory.

```
cd /path/to/bf2/mods
git clone https://github.com/senclan/sencityrp-server.git sandbox
```

This must be in a folder named `sandbox` in order for sandbox players to join
the server.

You can start the server by appending `+modPath mods/sandbox` to the bf2
dedicated server binary.
